      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hey there! I'm a former front-end developer that took a long detour into video &amp; photo production. I currently own &amp; operate a photo booth business, but the pandemic made me realize that I would like to eventually transition out of the event world. So I'm laying the groundwork that might take years to come to fruition.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Atlanta, GA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My work and hobbies often overlap! Entrepreneurship, systems automation, investing, photo/video, cooking (sourdough pizza, specifcally), hiking, and spending time with my family.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Systems automation consultant helping other business owners spend less time doing repetive manual work, so they can focus on the fun parts of building and running their business. Coding would certainly play a part in that type of job.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Seattle, WA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I took my first coding class while taking a semester off from college and absolutely fell in love. Writing code, saving the file, and instantly seeing a change in a page or app will never cease to delight me.</p>
